AI Document Insights
AI Document Insights is a tool that allows users to upload documents (such as PDFs or text files) and receive AI-powered answers to their questions based on the document’s content. The project uses advanced language models to extract, process, and analyze information from the document, enabling quick and accurate insights without manually reading the whole file.

Features
Upload documents and extract their content automatically

Ask questions and get relevant answers directly from the document

Uses AI to understand the context and provide precise responses

Handles large documents efficiently with document chunking and vector search

How It Works
Upload Document – The user uploads a PDF or text file.

Content Processing – The document is split into smaller chunks for better AI understanding.

Embedding Generation – Each chunk is converted into a vector representation.

Vector Search – When the user asks a question, the system finds the most relevant chunks.

AI Response – The selected chunks are passed to the AI model to generate a final answer.
